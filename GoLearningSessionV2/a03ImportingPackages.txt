// Packages are just folders that contain .go files
// They usually serve as function libraries.
//
// NOTE: Package names CANNOT have any capital letters, spaces, or special characters.
//       CamelCasing is NOT recommended.
//       Write all words as one word (e.g. studentutils).
//
// Beginning with upper case means Public.
// Beginning with lower case means Private.
//
// Anything Public can be used by importers of a Package.
// Anything Private can only be used within the Package -- this goes for Private fields as well.
//
// -------------------------------------------

// Importing packages one by one:

     import "fmt"
     import "strings"
     import "bytes"

// Importing multiple packages at once:
// (NOTE: This is the recommended approach, even for single imports)

     import (
         "fmt"
         "strings"
         "bytes"
     )

// Importing online packages:

    import (
        "golang.org/x/tools/container/intsets"
    )
